            <h1>Healthy Eating</h1>
            <p>A healthy diet is essential for good health and nutrition. It protects you against many chronic noncommunicable diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Eating a variety of foods and consuming less salt, sugars, and saturated and industrially-produced trans-fats are essential for a healthy diet.</p>
            
            <h2>Components of a Healthy Diet</h2>
            <p>A healthy diet comprises a combination of different foods, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Staples like cereals (wheat, barley, rye, maize, or rice) or starchy tubers or roots (potato, yam, taro, or cassava).</li>
                <li>Legumes (lentils and beans).</li>
                <li>Fruits and vegetables.</li>
                <li>Foods from animal sources (meat, fish, eggs, and milk).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>WHO Recommendations for a Healthy Diet</h2>
            <h3>1. Breastfeed Babies and Young Children</h3>
            <p>A healthy diet starts early in life - breastfeeding fosters healthy growth and may have long-term health benefits. Feeding babies exclusively with breast milk from birth to 6 months is important for a healthy diet.</p>

            <h3>2. Eat Plenty of Vegetables and Fruits</h3>
            <p>These are important sources of vitamins, minerals, dietary fiber, plant protein, and antioxidants. Diets rich in vegetables and fruits significantly lower the risk of obesity, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and certain types of cancer.</p>

            <h3>3. Eat Less Fat</h3>
            <p>Fats and oils are concentrated sources of energy. Eating too much, particularly the wrong kinds of fat, can increase the risk of heart disease and stroke. Use unsaturated vegetable oils (like olive, soy, sunflower, or corn oil) rather than animal fats.</p>

            <h3>4. Limit Intake of Sugars</h3>
            <p>For a healthy diet, sugars should represent less than 10% of your total energy intake. Choosing fresh fruits instead of sweet snacks helps reduce sugar consumption.</p>

            <h3>5. Reduce Salt Intake</h3>
            <p>Keeping salt intake to less than 5g per day helps prevent hypertension and reduces the risk of heart disease and stroke. Limiting high-sodium condiments when cooking also helps.</p>
